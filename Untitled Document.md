# Problem
We need to efficently detect possible duplocates which can be presented to the user for resolution. The cosine similarity algorithm is great for determining when two peices of text are similar.

## Naive, Ideal Solution
For every record, we could go through each relevant attribute and cosine compare it to every other record to detect similar records which may be duplocates. While this solution *will* find each duplocate, it's very slow on a large amount of data (think milions of entries) because it has O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexity.

## Current Solution
The current solution sorts each relevant attribute (optimized with an index). Then, for each entry, it compares that entry to the next few entries (usually 10). This solution is far faster, however, it misses many duplocates. For example, "John" and "JJohn" (an obvious typo) will sort far appart, and this duplocate will not be detected.

## Proposed Solution
Our proposed solution (the "vector" solution) selects the the relevant attributes and computes the hashed vector for each of them individually. Then, we store these hashed vectors in a new table (see below).


| p_key | README |
| ------ | ------ |

## Relevant Attributes
We chose to examine each person's first name, last name (surname), address, email, and phone number.

### Selecting data
- First name: Select p_preferred_name from p_partner. If it's missing, select given_name from p_partner.
- Surname: Select p_surname from p_partner.
- Address: Select p_address_1, p_address_2, p_address_3, p_city, p_state_province, p_country_code, and p_postal_code from p_location. (join p_partner on p_partner_key)
- Email: Select p_contact_info from p_location where p_contact_type = "E". (join p_partner on p_partner_key)
- Phone Number: Select p_phone_area_city and p_contact_info from p_location where p_contact_type = "C" or p_contact_type = "P". (join p_partner on p_partner_key)


# Markdown example (ignore)
Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- ✨ Magic ✨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable

> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
