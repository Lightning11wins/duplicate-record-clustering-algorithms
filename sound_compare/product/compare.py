* Metaphone and Levenshtein. It identifies the names based on their IDs and finds 
* potential duplicates efficiently using a sliding window approach.

# CONNECTION TO THE MARIADB on KARDIA-VM ---------------------------------------------

  # Assumes that a connection is available to the server on local port 3306

# DEFINITIONS AND FUNCTIONS ----------------------------------------------------------

# The following function, leven_words(name1, name2), does one simple action:
# Compare two words and return a number value that displays how similar they are using
# the levenshtein function. Would prefer cosine compare, this was simply a faster 
# implementation due to the constraints of the codathon.
#
# Desired input is two strings you wish to compare. 
def leven_words(name1, name2):
  distance = Levenshtein.distance(name1, name2)
  return 1 - (distance / max(len(name1), len(name2)))


# The following function, grab_names(cursor, id), does:
# Retrieve the given name and surname for a specific partner ID from the database and
# returns the full name as a string.
#
# The goal is so we can compare the first and last name of an individual rather than
# simply one or the other. 
#
# Desired input is the cursor for executing MariaDB commands, and a valid id from the
# p_partner table. 
def grab_names(cursor, id):
  cursor.execute(f"""
    SELECT p_given_name, p_surname FROM p_partner WHERE p_partner_key = {id};
  """)
  data = cursor.fetchall()
  return data[0][0] +  " " + data[0][1]


# The following function, sliding_window(cursor, cluster...) does:
# Given a cluster of ids, slide over the data with a given window size, and compare
# names within the window.
# 
# The expected input is a cursor to execute commands in MariaDB, a single cluster 
# (list of valid ids within the p_partner table), a window size (how many words 
# should be compared together), and the confidence value to output matches. Use a 
# number greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. 
# 
# The expected output is a printed list of the matches above the fiven confidence
# value.  
def sliding_window(cursor, cluster, window_size, confidence_val) :
  # Go through all the ids in the cluster except the last one, since it will be 
  # compared with all before it.
  for i in range(len(cluster)-1):
    # Makes sure not to go out of bounds. Loops through the window size or the smallest
    # rest of the ids in the cluster.
    j = 0
    for k in range(min(window_size, (len(cluster)-(i+j+1)))):
      j = k
      # Call grab names on the correct cluster spots, then check similarity.
      word1 = grab_names(cursor, cluster[i][0])
      word2 = grab_names(cursor, cluster[i+k+1][0])
      sim = leven_words(word1, word2)

      # Output values above the selected confidence value.
      if sim > confidence_val :
        print("Name One: " + word1 +
              "\tName Two: " + word2 +
              "\tSim Value: " + str(sim))
