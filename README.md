> Research for removing duplicate entries in Kardia


## Project Description

The goal of this project was to find duplicate entries in Kardia's database after the duplicate entries have already been made in less complexity than O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.


## Project Features

This project includes methods for:
* Clustering database entry properties based on similarity
* Identifying pairs of database entries with two or more properties in common


## Project Structure
The three different clustering methods are intended to output clusters of database entries clustered by similar properties, which feed into the synthesis program which outputs pairs of database entries which may be duplicates and need further analysis to determine if they are.


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version => 3.14
* [C++](https://gcc.gnu.org) version >= 14.2
